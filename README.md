# mixcloud-downloader
mixcloud downloader written in python

do not look at the code too closely because it might hurt your eyes

## dependencies
idk, if it complains about missing modules just install them with pip3 or something

## usage
to download a single mix just call mixcloud.py with the url as the first argument

`mixcloud.py https://www.mixcloud.com/TommyA80/laidback-drum-n-bass-lounge-sessions-7/`

to download a few more pass it the artist page, this will not download all tracks but only the latest 30, including reposts
